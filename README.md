## Project Overview

The PDF Summarizer Chatbot is a user-friendly application that allows you to upload PDF documents, ask questions about their content, and receive AI-generated answers using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). This project leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaningful insights from textual data, making document analysis faster and more efficient.

## Project Purpose

This project can be a starting point for beginners who want to learn about LLMs. I use **Replicate**, which provides **free** cloud API services with open-source models like **LLaMa2**. The open-source Python framework **Streamlit** is used to deploy the model into an interactive web app. Overall, this project was made as simple as possible to help your understanding of the implementation of the LLMs project.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Extract text from PDF files using PyPDF2.
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions about your uploaded PDF and get answers generated by the Llama 2 13B model via Replicate.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive chat-based platform for users to upload files and interact with the AI.
- **Themes**: Toggle between light and dark themes for user convenience.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the Replicate API for seamless communication with the LLM backend.

```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A Replicate API token (free tier available at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com))

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xichikawa/Llama2-pdf-summarizer.git
   cd Llama2-pdf-summarizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Replicate API key. Obtain your key from [replicate.com](https://replicate.com) and add it to the `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` folder:
   ```toml
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = "INSERT_YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the app and enter your Replicate API token in the sidebar (if not already configured in `secrets.toml`).
2. Upload a PDF file using the sidebar file uploader.
3. Once the text is extracted, type a question about the PDF content in the input field.
4. The AI assistant will generate a response based on the document.

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support for summarization.
- Enhanced text extraction with OCR for scanned PDFs.
- Options for customized summary lengths and formats.
